**Fresh News Application**

**Problem Statement :**

Many of the family members and residents of the neighborhood were not able to get the current news during the lockdown period, so I decided to build a news application. In the current scenario, a mobile application is one of the major developments that anyone can use.

**Proposed Solution :**

This project proposes a “News-App” which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet by making an API call and displaying the news title, image, description, and author name in the recycler view. On clicking news image or title it will show the full news article with the help of Custom Tabs. This project uses Postman API. This is a well-maintained API that returns information in a JSON format.

**Functionality & Concepts used :**

* RecyclerView : To present the list of different platform news in a scrollable mode in an efficient way. Postman API: we are also using the Postman News API free version. 
  *	Adapter : It provides a binding from an app specific data set to views that are displayed within a RecyclerView.
  *	ViewHolder: Holding the XML code.
  *	Layout manager: It arrange the items of the list.

* Constraint Layout : Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.

* Custom Tabs : In this application we use chrome custom tabs gives more control over their web experience and make transition between native and web content more seamless without having to resort to a WebView.

* Glide : We are also using Glide library to load and display images from many sources and is a library that is recommended by Google.

* Volley : It makes networking very easy and fast for this app.

Once the app is successfully completed we are thinking to purchase an API for it and upload it to Play Store as well. And trying to collaborate with other news service team. And also we are planning to add some new features for user convenience to choose a specific news topics.
